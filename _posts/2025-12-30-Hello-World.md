Welcome to my digital space! I am **{{site.author-name}}**, an aspiring **Junior Developer** dedicated to building clean, functional web projects while mastering modern technology stacks.

I created this site not just as a portfolio, but as a place to document my growth and connect with like-minded professionals, mentors, and founders.

### My Technical Toolkit
My development focus is centered on building robust applications from the ground up:
* **Backend Mastery**: Crafting logic and APIs using **Python**, **Django**, and **FastAPI**, backed by **PostgreSQL**.
* **Frontend Craft**: Building responsive interfaces with **React**, **JavaScript**, and **Bulma/SCSS**.
* **Deployment & AI**: Streamlining workflows using **Docker**, **Nginx**, and modern **AI development tools** like Claude and DeepSeek.

### How We Can Collaborate
As mentioned on my [about page]({{ site.baseurl }}/#about), I am actively looking for opportunities to apply my skills in real-world scenarios:

* **For Engineering Teams**: I am open for **Internships and Mentorship**. I am a fast learner eager to contribute to a professional team and learn from experienced developers.
* **For Non-Profits**: I provide reliable support for NGOs through **web page updates and automation**, helping you focus on your mission while I handle the tech.
* **For Individual Founders**: If you have a fresh idea, I can help you turn it into a **functional web prototype** or a high-converting landing page.

### What to Expect Here
Moving forward, I’ll be using this blog to share:
1.  **Project Deep-Dives**: Breakdowns of the challenges I face while building MVPs.
2.  **Learning Milestones**: Insights into new tools or frameworks I’m exploring.
3.  **Collaborations**: Showcasing work done for non-profits and startups.
